Cumulus
=======
Cumulus is a cross-platform weather app. It is aimed at phones, but it should work on tablets and desktops as well. Cumulus uses the [Enyo][] javascript framework, and forecast data is obtained from [forecast.io][]

Deployment
----------
Cumulus deploys natively to webOS, and packages and runs with no modification on Android using Cordova. Support is planned for iOS, Windows Phone 8, Blackberry 10, FirefoxOS, and Tizen. Hopefully. Maybe.
